**Hacker News** (**HN**) is a [social news website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_news_website "Social news website") focusing on [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science") and [entrepreneurship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship "Entrepreneurship"). It is run by the investment fund and startup incubator [Y Combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator "Y Combinator"). In general, content that can be submitted is defined as "anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity."<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>

The word _[hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker "Hacker")_ in "Hacker News" is used in its original meaning and refers to the [hacker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture "Hacker culture") which consists of people who enjoy tinkering with technology.

The site was created by [Paul Graham](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(computer_programmer)> "Paul Graham (computer programmer)") in February 2007.<sup id="cite_ref-tc-evol_2-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News#cite_note-tc-evol-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Initially called Startup News or occasionally News.YC., it became known by its current name on August 14, 2007.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> It developed as a project of Graham's company [Y Combinator](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Combinator_(company)> "Y Combinator (company)"), functioning as a real-world application of the [Arc](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_(programming_language)> "Arc (programming language)") programming language which Graham co-developed.<sup id="cite_ref-PG_WIL_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News#cite_note-PG_WIL-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup>

At the end of March 2014, Graham stepped away from his leadership role at Y Combinator, leaving Hacker News administration in the hands of other staff members.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The site is currently moderated by Daniel Gackle who posts under the username _dang_.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Gackle co-moderated Hacker News with Scott Bell (username _sctb_) until 2019 when Bell stopped working on the site.<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup>

## Vision and practices

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hacker_News&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Vision and practices")\]

The intention was to recreate a community similar to the early days of [Reddit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit "Reddit").<sup id="cite_ref-tc-evol_2-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News#cite_note-tc-evol-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-PG_AYC_9-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News#cite_note-PG_AYC-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> However, unlike Reddit where new users can immediately both upvote and downvote content, Hacker News does not allow users to downvote content until they have accumulated 501 "karma" points. Karma points are calculated as the number of upvotes a given user's content has received minus the number of downvotes.<sup id="cite_ref-tc-evol_2-2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News#cite_note-tc-evol-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> "Flagging" comments, likewise, is not permitted until a user has 30 karma points.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>

Graham stated he hopes to avoid the [Eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September "Eternal September") that results in the general decline of intelligent discourse within a community.<sup id="cite_ref-PG_WIL_4-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News#cite_note-PG_WIL-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> The site has a proactive attitude in moderating content, including automated [flame](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaming_(Internet)> "Flaming (Internet)") and [spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming "Spamming") detectors and active human moderation. It also practices [stealth banning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_banning "Stealth banning") in which user posts stop appearing for others to see, unbeknownst to the user.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Additional software is used to detect "voting rings to purposefully vote up stories".<sup id="cite_ref-tc-evol_2-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News#cite_note-tc-evol-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>

According to a 2013 [TechCrunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch "TechCrunch") article: "Graham says that Hacker News gets a lot of complaints that it has a bias toward featuring stories about Y Combinator startups, but he says there is no such bias. \[...\] Graham adds that he gets a lot of vitriol from users personally with accusations of bias or censoring."<sup id="cite_ref-tc-evol_2-4"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News#cite_note-tc-evol-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
